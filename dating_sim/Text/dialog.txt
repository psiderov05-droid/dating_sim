Ugghhh. . . .*MC*No*
(while wearing a school uniform): I hate my life! I am in the prime of it, yet I have no \ngirlfriend, I am failing at most of my tests because I can't concentrate in class, my \nparents told me to get out of the house to an apartment they own even though I am \nonly 17 and to top it all off, I'm broke!*MC*No*
Maaaaaan! This life is not worth it! I wish I could live in a different world in which I \nwas free from it all. No more parental neglect, no more being penniless, no more being \nwithout a maiden by my side!*MC*No*
(Sign) I guess that only happens in anime and movies, so I will just be going to \nmy small 100 square feet apartment.*MC*No*
[MC is crossing the zebra walk]* *No*
(coming at 100km per hour): Shkrrrrugh!*Truck-kun*No*
Huh! No way! I can’t die like this!*MC*No*
[Truck-kun runs over MC, crushing his neck and skull.]* *No*
[Scene opens in a sun-dappled forest glade. The air smells of pine and wildflowers. \nA young man, MC, regains consciousness, lying on soft moss surrounded by mud. \nNearby stands a curious cat-girl, ears twitching and tail flicking, eyes wide in surprise.]* *No*
(groggy, blinking): W‑Where… am I?*MC*No*
(voice soft with curiosity, tilting her head): I... I'm not sure. You just... \nappeared here out of nowhere. Are you… okay?*Catgirl*No*
(groaning, sits up slowly, clutching his side): My head... what happened? One \nmoment, I was walking down the street, and then... something fast hit me. A metal \ntruck, I think?*MC*No*
(eyes widen, stepping closer but still cautious): A... truck? You're saying you came \nfrom another world, and a one with strange iron beasts that run on roads at that?*Catgirl*No*
(panting, nods): Yeah... it sounds insane, but that's what happened. Then everything \nwent white, and I woke up here. Feels like a dream.*MC*No*
(kneels, tilting her head): A dream… or perhaps the gods have sent you here. \nYou’ve awakened in the realm of Ramora, stranger. I’m Neki. A huntress of the \nMoonreliya Woods. And you... you just showed up in my clearing.*Catgirl*No*
(attempting to stand, then stumbling): Ramora...? You mean this isn’t Earth?*MC*No*
(smiling gently, ears flicking anxiously): No, this is not your Earth. Here, magic \nflows in the air and monsters of times old and new roam. You're... foreign magic. I've \nnever felt magic like yours before.*Neki*No*
(eyes widen at the implication): Magic like mine! What does that mean?*MC*No*
(softly touching his forehead): It’s... faint, but distinct. You belong, somehow... but \nyou don’t belong. You’re between worlds, MC. We must discover why you were brought \nhere…and how to send you home or ... if you even can go back.*Neki*No*
(breathing deeply, glancing around): So… you’re… going to help me?*MC*No*
(smiles brightly, tail swishing): I will. For now, rest. Eat. We'll talk more when you’re \nstronger. I’ll bring you near my village where you can… decide your fate.*Neki*No*
