Ugghhh……*MC*No*
I hate my life! I am in the prime of it, yet I have no girlfriend, I am failing at most of my tests because I can’t concentrate in class, my parents told me to get out of the house to an apartment they own even though I am only 17 and to top it all off, I’m broke!*MC (while wearing a school uniform)*No*
Maaaaaan! This life is not worth it! I wish I could live in a different world in which I was free from it all. No more parental neglect, no more being penniless, no more being without a maiden by my side!*MC*No*
(Sign) I guess that only happens in anime and movies, so I will just be going to my small 100 square feet apartment.*MC*No*
[MC is crossing the zebra walk]* *No*
Truck-kun(coming at 100km per hour): Shkrrrrugh!* *No*
Huh! No way! I can’t die like this!*MC*No*
[Truck-kun runs over MC, crushing his neck and skull.]* *No*
